norders   = 1									orders in band. must match following six entries
wrange1   = [2.355,2.391] 						in microns. approimate okay. [wmin,wmax]
yrange1   = [108,219]							use ds9. A,B nods must be separated by bisector of [ymin,ymax]
A1        = [ 2.356270,     2.356270] 			0th order coefficient for initial guess of wavelength solution. [A,B]
B1        = [ 3.466778e-05, 3.466778e-05]		linear coefficient for initial guess of wavelength solution. [A,B]
C1        = [-8.953778e-09, -8.953778e-09] 		quadratic coefficient for initial guess of wavelength solution. [A,B]
R1        = [25000.0, 25000.0]					resolving power. atmospheric model is convolved to data resolution. [A,B]
